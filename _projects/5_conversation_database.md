## Overview

The Joshua Project Conversation Database is a comprehensive conversation storage and retrieval system designed specifically for the four-phase progressive training of Context Engineering Transformers. Built on Irina's 60TB+ tiered storage infrastructure, this system enables the capture, organization, and semantic retrieval of conversational data at massive scale.

## Key Features

- **PostgreSQL + pgvector Architecture**: Combines relational data management with vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Phase-Specific Optimization**: Specialized storage and indexing for each of the four training phases
- **Tiered Storage**: Intelligent lifecycle management across fast (300+ MB/s) and slow (30 MB/s) storage tiers
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Vector embeddings enable similarity search across conversations
- **Scalable Design**: Handles 20TB active training data plus 40TB+ archived conversations
- **Sub-100ms Latency**: Optimized for critical production queries

## Technical Foundation

The system is built on several core principles:

1. **Hybrid Data Model**: Relational core with vector components for semantic search
2. **Phase-Specific Tables**: Distinct data structures for Phase 1-4 training requirements
3. **Intelligent Archival**: Automatic data lifecycle management based on age and access patterns
4. **Production-Ready**: Designed to handle 100K+ conversations per training phase

## Use Cases

- **Phase 1**: Storing and indexing subject-specific conversations for transformation
- **Phase 2**: Maintaining context transformation pairs with quality gradients
- **Phase 3**: Recording interactive feedback loops with multi-LLM responses
- **Phase 4**: Providing fast access to conversation history for production inference
