## RMDev Research

We conduct industry-changing research on LLM development methodologies through comprehensive data collection and rigorous analysis. Our work focuses on understanding and optimizing conversational AI development processes.

### Research Focus

Our laboratory specializes in:

- **Conversational AI Development**: Systematic analysis of LLM interaction patterns and development workflows
- **Data-Driven Methodology**: Comprehensive collection and analysis of development conversations
- **Production Learning Systems**: Real-world implementation and validation of research findings
- **Continuous Improvement Cycles**: Iterative refinement through empirical observation

### Approach

We employ a unique research methodology that combines:

1. **Live Data Collection**: Capturing real development conversations and interactions
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Rigorous examination of patterns, challenges, and solutions
3. **Empirical Validation**: Testing findings in production environments
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on observed outcomes

### Publications

Our research outputs are documented as comprehensive papers and fragments, providing detailed insights into LLM development methodologies. Browse our [publications](/publications/) and [blog](/blog/) for the latest findings.

### Collaboration

We welcome discussions about collaboration opportunities and knowledge sharing in the field of conversational AI development research.
