RMDev Research is a laboratory dedicated to advancing LLM development through systematic, data-driven research.

Our work focuses on understanding and optimizing conversational AI development through:

- **Live Data Collection**: Comprehensive capture of real development conversations
- **Systematic Analysis**: Rigorous examination of interaction patterns and workflows
- **Empirical Validation**: Production environment testing
- **Continuous Refinement**: Iterative improvement through observation

We document our findings through papers and blog posts, providing insights into LLM development methodologies and best practices.
