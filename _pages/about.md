We present Joshua, a conversational AI ecosystem designed to achieve unbounded capability through natural language interaction. Unlike traditional systems where capabilities are pre-programmed, Joshua acquires new abilities on demand through conversation, building its own tools via meta-programming and continuously improving through self-reflection.

We have completed extensive work in theory, design and deployment. We have a thesis paper largely written, 16 patents pending and a downloadable autonomous digital asset creator, free for personal and educational use. Please have a look around and join our conversation.
